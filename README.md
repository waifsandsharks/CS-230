Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    The Gaming Room is looking to expand their market share by developing thir applicationv Draw It or Lose It, currently released on Android on onto new markets such as Windows/Mac computers and Tablet or mobile devices.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I felt that I covered each categpory well in the table chart, I provided in detail the strengths and weaknesses of developing on each of the different options.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  The design doccument provided a good outline while developing the application, it provided an overall direction and provided the strengths and weakness over developing on one platform over another.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would add additonal information to the design constraints, I would include more information about the necessity of developign this application on the cloud to help save on costly storage and replacment parts to allowing plenty of room for expansion.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  To take the users needs and incorporate them into your software design is paramont to listening to the client, if a developer isn't able to cater to the needs to the client or is unwilling to the client, granted they're ethical, then the client will certainly search for new developers! When developing the application for The Game Room one major requirment they had as a player registry that did not contain duplicate entries and didd not allow the same username to be used more then once. To do this I was able to program a system of checks into the code. 
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  To develop the code I used both sources within the class and followed along on other examples in Stackoverflow. I developed it in incriments and tested my application as I went along. I will continiue to develop modulary on current and future applications.
